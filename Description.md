This is a begginer project running HTML, CSS and Javascript.
There are 3 buttons which by pressind them you will be able to change the background color of the website.
The last button plays with the RGB values which go from 0 - 255, using the Math.Random() function we calculate a number and we then multiply it by 255. 
In this way we have random numbers everytime we press the random button and it then creates different colors for the background of the website.
